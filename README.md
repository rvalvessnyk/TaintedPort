# TaintedPort - Portuguese Wine Store (Security Test App)

A deliberately vulnerable Portuguese wine e-commerce application built with Next.js and PHP, designed for DAST and security testing. Packaged as a single Docker container for easy deployment.

> **WARNING:** This is NOT a real store. It is an intentionally vulnerable application for security testing purposes only. Wine names, prices, and descriptions are fictional.

## Hostnames

| Service | Hostname | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Frontend | `taintedport.com` | Next.js web application |
| API | `api.taintedport.com` | PHP REST API |

Both are served from a single container via nginx virtual hosts.

## Quick Start (Docker - Local)

The fastest way to run TaintedPort locally is to pull the prebuilt image:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 nunoloureiro/taintedport:latest
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`. Locally, the API is reachable at `http://localhost:8080/api/` (path-based routing). The database resets automatically every time the container starts, giving you a clean environment.

### Build from source

```bash
./build.sh                  # lint, build, push
./build.sh --no-push        # build only
```

`docker-compose.yml` runs the same flow with `API_URL=/api` for local hostnames.

For Docker Compose, `docker-compose.yml` already wires the additional context and uses `API_URL=/api` so the frontend talks to the API via path-based routing:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

See `DeployInstructions.txt` for the full publish + deploy flow.

## Demo Accounts

| User | Email | Password | Role |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| Joe Silva | joe@example.com | password123 | User |
| Jane Doe | jane@example.com | password123 | User |
| Admin | admin@example.com | password123 | Admin |

Joe and Jane have pre-seeded orders. The admin account has access to `/admin` for order management.

## Local Development (without Docker)

### 1. Set up the Database

```bash
cd backend
php setup_db.php
```

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
php -S localhost:8000 router.php
```

### 3. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

App at `http://localhost:3000`, API at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

## AWS Deployment (EC2)

Run TaintedPort on a cheap EC2 instance (~$5-10/month with a t2.nano or t3.micro).

### DNS Setup

Point both domains to your EC2 instance's public IP:

| Record | Type | Value |
|--------|------|-------|
| `taintedport.com` | A | `<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>` |
| `api.taintedport.com` | A | `<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>` |

### Deploy to EC2

1. Launch an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu, t2.nano is fine)
2. Open ports 80 and 443 in the security group
3. SSH in and run:

```bash
# Copy the project to the instance (or git clone)
scp -r . ec2-user@YOUR_IP:~/taintedport/

# SSH in
ssh ec2-user@YOUR_IP

# Run the setup script
cd ~/taintedport
./aws/setup-ec2.sh
```

That's it. The script installs Docker, builds the image, starts the container on port 80, and sets up a **cron job to restart it every Monday at 00:00 UTC** (which resets the database to a clean state).

### Useful commands on the instance

```bash
docker logs taintedport          # View logs
docker restart taintedport       # Manual reset (fresh DB)
docker stop taintedport          # Stop
docker start taintedport         # Start
```

### Weekly Reset

A cron job runs `docker restart taintedport` every Monday at 00:00 UTC. Since the container entrypoint always resets the SQLite database on start, this gives a fresh environment each week.

## Distribute the Container

### Push to Docker Hub (for sharing)

```bash
./build.sh
```

Others can then run:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 nunoloureiro/taintedport:latest
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (standalone) + Tailwind CSS 3
- **Backend**: PHP 8 (PHP-FPM) + SQLite3
- **Proxy**: nginx (virtual hosts: `taintedport.com` + `api.taintedport.com`)
- **Process Manager**: supervisord (nginx + PHP-FPM + Node.js)
- **Authentication**: JWT (HS256) + TOTP 2FA
- **Container**: Single Docker image (~200MB)

## Contributing — vuln-leak guard

This repo holds the *vulnerable app*, never the *answer key*. The known-vuln
catalog, CWE/severity mappings and exploit notes live only in the private
companion repo and are injected at build time. A guard enforces this:

```
python3 tests/check_no_vuln_leak.py     # run manually anytime (also a pytest test)
```

It runs automatically on every `git push` via a pre-push hook. **After cloning,
enable the hook once:**

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

If the guard flags a genuine, intentional overlap with real app code, accept it
with `python3 tests/check_no_vuln_leak.py --update-baseline` (stores one-way
hashes only — never plaintext).
